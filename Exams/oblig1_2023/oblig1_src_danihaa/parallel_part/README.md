### Parallel part

Similarly to the serial part, make sure to run from the terminal, from **outside** of the `serial_part` or `parallel_part` (i.e., in the same directory as the `makefile`) 


```
make compile_parallel
```

And to run the executable, run the command 

```
make run_parallel
```

**OBS:** the timing print from the parallel program is composed of an average of over 10 runs, and because of that, it can take around 30 seconds to run.
